<h1>The Best Movies According to Andres</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies in no Particular Order</h2>
<hr />

<h2>Django: Unchained</h2>
<p>From the great mind of Quentin Tarantino, this movie
    blends action, romance, and drama into a spectacle 
that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. </p>

<h2>The Dark Knight</h2>
<P>From the cast to the sound direction, the whole movie
    comes together for a joyride of ever-building tension,
    eventually culminating in an ending going against the grain.</P>

<h2>The Thing</h2>
<p>Most people are not inclined to add horror movies to their,
top movies lists, but I am not most people. "The Thing" is much more
than just blood and gore (though there is plenty of that), it's
a brilliant look into the minds of those faced with imminent
death and deciding who to trust.
