<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I come from a small family of just my mother and older brother, who did their best to mold me into the man you see today. Growing up in Kissimme, Florida
  I learned how to deal with turmoil in the case of hurricanes and other natural disasters. My father had left when I was but three years old and
  it was that determination I saw in my mother that instilled in me the drive to keep going.
</p>

<p>I eventually moved to the state of Utah during my high school days. It was there I learned about young "love" and trying to find out
  who I really was. After graduating, I spent the following two years in Hong Kong, learning the language and culture and thoroughly falling 
  in love with the atmosphere. I came back home and knew what I needed to do...
</p>

<p>...Or so I thought. I did marry someone and with her, I sired my firstborn child, Kai. But that marriage seemed almost doomed to fail, and so
  we parted ways, keeping a very healthy and mature relationship for my son's sake. Now, I am in the midst of rediscovery, not sure exactly where
  I am going to wind up but knowing that I need to move forward in life.
